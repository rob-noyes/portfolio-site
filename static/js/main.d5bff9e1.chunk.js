Utilizing these frameworks, I created a functional front-end site that includes some featues I have never worked on before.","Content":"By creating a shopping cart within the site, I was able to use React States to add items to an overall cart, as well as changing the quantity or deleting from the cart itself.  This was the biggest challenge I had, but implementing and seeing it work was a huge success for me.  ","Content2":"I also used states and React Router for the navigation bar on mobile, allowing for the user to change pages.  Finally, I created this site using a mobile-first approach, allowing the user to use this site in mobile, tablet, or desktop form, with different layouts depending on the size of the screen. Overall, I found that states are much more difficult in a multi paged site, and am looking forward to learning some Redux to help with states on a project of a larger size.","images":["./images/projects/room/desktop1.png","./images/projects/room/desktop2.png"],"alt":"room design website, contemporary furniture","color":"#ecb6b6"},{"id":1,"projectName":"Tip Jar","linkname":"tipjar","link":"https://rob-noyes.github.io/tip-jar/","github":"https://github.com/rob-noyes/tip-jar","tags":"Javascript / ReactJS / TailwindCSS","description":"Tip Jar was created from the thought of having a quick and easy way to figure out a tip without needing to do the math yourself.","Content":"Utilizing React.js and using TailwindCSS for the first time, I wanted to focus on buidling a good looking web app.  Using react states allowed for me to carry the balance of the check, and utilize different states based on the tip percentage clicked, or set a specific amount.","Content2":"By using Tailwind, I was able to quickly put together a clean looking site.  I even delved into the specifics of adding my own stlyes through color optiosn and font inside of tailwind configs extend option. Overall I\'m happy with the process and learned a lot on how states and tailwind work.","images":["./images/projects/tipjar/desktop.png","./images/projects/tipjar/mobile.png"],"alt":"tipjar website, calculator for tips","color":"#b6d8ec"},{"id":2,"projectName":"Cast","linkname":"cast","link":"https://rob-noyes.github.io/Cast/","github":"https://github.com/rob-noyes/Cast","tags":"Vanilla Javascript / CSS","description":"Cast was my first project delving into async functions and fully utilziing Open Weather API for fetching data on the backend.","Content":"This project was a breakthrough for me working with Javascript without frameworks.  Finding the right way to fetch data from an API, and seeing it come to life was a big step for me.","Content2":"Utilizing Javascripts Async and Await functions, I used fetch within async to allow the data from the API to start fetching while other javascript processes could be completed in the meantime.  I learned structure for my work as well, utilizing folders and modules in anticipation of working in React with the component structure.","images":["./images/projects/cast/castDesktop.png"],"color":"#b6ecb6"}]}')},33:function(e,t,i){"use strict";i.r(t);i(2);var s=i(14),n=i.n(s),a=(i(21),i(6)),o=i(3),c=(i(22),i(1)),r=function(){return Object(c.jsx)("div",{className:"header-container",children:Object(c.jsx)("button",{className:"header-button",children:"Rob Noyes"})})},l=i(9),d=i(8),h=function(){return Object(c.jsx)("div",{className:"contact-container",children:Object(c.jsxs)("div",{className:"social-buttons",children:[Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"mailto: robertjnoyes1@gmail.com",children:Object(c.jsx)(d.b,{})}),Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://github.com/rob-noyes",children:Object(c.jsx)(l.b,{})}),Object(c.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rnoyes/",children:Object(c.jsx)(l.c,{})})]})})},j=function(){return Object(c.jsx)("div",{className:"about",children:Object(c.jsx)("p",{children:"In tempor ea quis exercitation sunt et voluptate do.

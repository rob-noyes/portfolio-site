      <p>
        I'm a <span className="about-bold">developer</span> and{' '}
        <span className="about-bold">designer</span> focused on front-end
        development, and I have been building on the web for the past two years.
        I specialize in responsive, dynamic sites without sacrificing
        creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my skillset, I focus on Reactjs, and have been working with
        TailwindCSS as my latest CSS framework. Creating with these frameworks
        has shown how much they can expedite the process of building sites and
        applications.
